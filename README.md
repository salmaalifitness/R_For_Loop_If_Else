# Welcome to my Project: Job-Search! 
#Simple skills demonstrated will be: For Loops, If-Else, WordCloud, and BarPlot using R!<br>
#What is not shared: The data sets containing the "qualifications" sections of the job descriptions and dates applied which are used in this project are not shared due to privacy reasons.<br>
#What is shared: I have shared my R Script code below for this project!

#I applied to 30 jobs related to data analytics! For every interview, I will need at least 60 minutes to prepare.<br>
#Let's see how many interviews I have scheduled to plan ahead using If-Else inside a For Loop. <br>

#It looks like I have some work to do in order to be elected for interviews. <br>
#I need to analyze the "qualifications" sections in the job descriptions to see which skills I need to focus more on.<br>
#Let's analyze the job requirements by using text mining stratagies for jobs I have applied for relating to data analysis.<br>
#We can start with WordCloud!<br>

#The biggest words in the word cloud were "data", "engineering", "science", and "degree". <br>
#It seems as though the majority of jobs I applied to are looking for candidates with a data science or data engineering degree. <br>
#I am working on my MBA in business analtyics that has helped me develop my skills in SQL, R, excel, statistics, data analysis, and data base management systems using Microsoft Access. <br>
#Furthermore, I am working on online skills certification to continue refining my data science math stratagies and python syntax. <br> 
#I need to find the frequency of the qualifications I do have to see which skills I need to emphasize the most on my resume. <br>
#Let's create a barplot to visualize the percentage of the occurance of skills mentioned above within the 30 job descriptions.<br>

#Almost half of the job postings required knowledge of data analysis methods. Nearly 40% of the jobs I applied to required knowledge of SQL and Python. <br>
#None of the jobs required Microsoft Access proficiency, and only about 13% mentioned an MBA as a qualifying degree. <br>
#Moving forward, I need to focus on refining my skills for data analysis methods using Python and SQL. <br>
#Perhaps that will be my new project!<br>
#Good luck to everyone who is also on the hunt for a job!<br>
